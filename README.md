2.Problem Statement:
Create a Dashboard based on which User would be able to analyze the sentiment of the specific 
stock. You’re required to create an Analytical Server "OHLC" (Open/High/Low/Close) time series 
based on the ‘Stock List’ dataset which will be provided to you in a separate JSON format and its 
output should be a timely report printed in Charts. 

3.Technologies Used:
  Different open source,plotting libraries in Python like plotly to plot various types of charts.

 We tried to parse the  provided json file to csv file and use Javascript to manipulate the data,but being new to these technologies and shortage of time ,only the python way is    implemented.
